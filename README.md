# CryptoClustering

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Use the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

Create a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

1. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame

2. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data

3. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis

4. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data

5. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
